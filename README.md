# Introduction
The problem with offline games is that one has to download the game to play. While it may seem convenient sometimes, but when there is a need to play variety of games then it becomes too hectic to download all the games individually. It may also happen that some may end up downloading spam, viruses, malicious software etc. In our website people can have fun by playing the games without downloading. All they need is a good internet connection.
